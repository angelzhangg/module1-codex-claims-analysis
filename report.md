# Medical Codexes Claims Analysis
In my code, I identified 8 unique medical codex and the the frequency of each codex.
The most common codes found were related to the principal diagnostic codes of the claim where stress and social support came out on top.
Present on Admission (POA) status for a claim was also high meaning that majority of the patients came in with a diagnosis upon admission.
In my code, I first inported pandas and loaded in the cvs file. Then, I listed out all the columns of the file to identify which codex were present.
Lastly, I identiied my 8 unique medical codex and the unique count of each codex.
There were some columns that had missing or null values and I excluded them form the analysis
### Challenges
The challenges to this assignment was figuring out how to display the columns in a more efficient way. I wanted to see a longer list of the rows with for each of the medical codes However, I could not figure out how to display more of them.
